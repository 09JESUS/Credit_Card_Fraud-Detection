Credit Card Fraud Detection 🕵️‍♂️💳
Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains anonymized credit card transactions with a focus on identifying fraudulent activities.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and scales features for better model performance.
Model Training: Implements a Logistic Regression model to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
Evaluation: Utilizes metrics such as Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Precision-Recall Curve to assess model performance.
Getting Started 🚀
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Installation
Clone the repository:

cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset (creditcard.csv) used in this project is too large to be included in the repository. You can download it from the following link:

Download Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
Once downloaded, place the creditcard.csv file in the project directory.

Usage
Load and explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance. Detailed instructions for these steps are available in the project's scripts.

Evaluation Metrics 📊
Confusion Matrix: Visualizes the performance of the classification model.
ROC Curve: Shows the true positive rate versus false positive rate, with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) indicating overall performance.
Precision-Recall Curve: Illustrates the trade-off between precision and recall, with Average Precision (AP) as a summary metric.
